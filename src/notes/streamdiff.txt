Stream :
Runs on a single-core of the computer
Performance is poor
Order is maintained
Only a single iteration at a time just like the for-loop.
Each iteration waits for currently running one to finish,
More reliable and less error
Platform independent

Parallel Stream :
Utilize the multiple cores of the computer.
The performance is high.
Doesnâ€™t care about the order,
Operates multiple iterations simultaneously in different available cores.
Waits only if no cores are free or available at a given time.
Less reliable and error-prone.
Platform dependent
